   Hardware setup of the PrivateHome controller.

Router requirements
-------------------
The router needs to be in Access Point mode to make sure it will not act as a gateway by itself and it will always go through the PrivateHome controller. 
Furthermore you need to remember the WiFi login credentials in order to connect all smart home devices to the wifi router.

.. note::
    The router credentials should be different as your own wifi network. Otherwise devices can connect to your own WiFi network instead of the PrivateHome network.


Raspberry Pi requirements
-------------------------
The raspberry pi needs to have a SD card with a minimum storage of 16Gb.
